QUESTION:
You are given 2 numbers (n, m); the task is to find nâˆšm (nth root of m).

Example:

Input: n = 2, m = 9
Output: 3
Explanation: 3^2 = 9

Input: n = 3, m = 9
Output: -1
Explanation: 3rd root of 9 is not an integer.

APPROACH:
We can use a binary search algorithm to find the nth root of m.
1. Initialize the search range with low = 1 and high = m.
2. While low is less than or equal to high:
   - Calculate the mid value as the average of low and high.
   - If mid raised to the power of n is equal to m, return mid.
   - If mid raised to the power of n is less than m, update low to mid + 1.
   - If mid raised to the power of n is greater than m, update high to mid - 1.
3. If the loop exits without finding the nth root, return -1.


CODE:
*/

int NthRoot(int n, int m) {
    int low = 1, high = m;
    while (low <= high) {
        long long mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
        if (pow(mid, n) == m)
            return mid;
        else if (pow(mid, n) < m)
            low = mid + 1;
        else
            high = mid - 1;
    }
    return -1;
}

/*
TIME COMPLEXITY: O(log m)
The binary search algorithm runs in logarithmic time complexity as it reduces the search range by half at each step.

SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(1)
The algorithm uses a constant amount of space to store the variables and perform calculations.
